# TODO

## make tools configurable: jira is just one of them

normal workflow:

1. create ticket
2. list tickets in todo
3. assign ticket
4. move ticket to in progress
5. create branch
6. commit with format
7. create PR/MR
8. move ticket to in review
9. move ticket to done

- refactor: each command in its own file
- add "smart parse" of positional arugments: recognize issue keys and list cmds
- add tree view: Epic > Task/Story > Sub-task
